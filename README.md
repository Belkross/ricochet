# Ricochet

Ricochet is a board game where you need associate words together to progress and finally find the secret end of a dialogue.

This project is a reproduction of a real board game created by Cyril Blondel. It intends to be a tribute to his work and I hope some people will have as much fun as I had playing this game.
